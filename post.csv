I feel like a lot of the chaos is also because it’s the first week and everyone is excited!I don’t know if a criteria for meaningful conversations would be necessary but in terms of noise reduction I think reminding students to reply in threads would be very helpful.

91,Sohaib Tariq,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity @Jordan.Udacity It would be awesome if you could share some sort of rubric that you'll use to evaluate community participation. i.e. what constitutes active participation ?  Perhaps this will prevent people from posting needlessly just to gain visibility and will allow us to focus more clearly on what matters,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Sohaib Tariq Please see my answers above to Ola and Andrew  . TY!
92,Adi Nugroho,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Does attendance for a webinar session like orientation will be counted for advancing to phase 2?,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Adi Nugroho! Orientation attendance is not required! But it IS important to help you get the ""lay of the land"" so that you are successful in this Phase!"
96,Hamid Ali,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity @Palak.Udacity I have created a group using the form provided but it is still not available in the google sheet on google site. I guess it will need an admin verification right?,Palak.Udacity,@Hamid Ali Thanks for flagging this! You should be able to view it now!
98,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-25 0:00:00,I am not finding the study group filters however i realize the study groups are still pending where you need at least 8 persons to join and then the approval process (edited) ,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Andrew Lawe! You actually don't need 8 people to start a Study Group - you can start one with as little as one!http://bit.ly/cloud-studygroupscc @Palak for more on the filters
99,Lesliel,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity will there be any new content for the challenging course?,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Lesliel! We won't be adding new content to the Challenge course. That said, if you find yourself finishing early look at it as an excellent opportunity to either a.) Review what you have learned b.) Create something that demonstrates what you have learned c) Use the time to help your classmates grasp the concepts and finish as well!"
100,Sohaib Tariq,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity will community managers be evaluating community participation of students or will someone else ?,Jordan.Udacity,Yes it'll be us evaluating community participation @Sohaib Tariq

Till now, i can't see the registered group in the directory",Brenda.Udacity,"Hi all! I haven't checked to see if we have any Study Groups registered yet , but they should be appearing if they are! cc @Palak"

We recommend saving any course material before the program deadline of March 5, 2020 as it has not yet been confirmed if scholars will continue to have access post deadline!"

107,Mo Ehab,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Are we able to access the course material  after the challenge ?,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Mo Ehab! I would go with the notion that you will not be able to access the Challenge coursework post deadline until we can get final confirmation!
108,Talha Ahmed,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity  just wanted to know that if we are active and not participate in ama sessions because many of the questions are already answered and no point in spamming does that count as participation as well ? Also I have seen many replies on a single post and no point in answering again so what should we do in that case ? Regards Talha Ahmed,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Talha Ahmed! I respect and appreciate your awareness about spamming! (or as Ionnis says, ""flooding""   Please know that answering questions is just one way to participate as you can also be a Student Leader or a Study Groups Organizer, you can volunteer during Study Jam or host a learning webinar. Think out of the box!  The sky is the limit! (edited) "

110,Alex,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Hope it hasn't been asked before ...Was this challenge course offered last year as well and if so what was the experience like for students and evaluaters regarding the selection process? What were the arguments against selecting through exam results which would have been objective and transparent in my view?,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Alex! We had a previous Bertelsmann Scholarship for Data in 2018. We've done numerous Scholarship programs with different variations of Phase 1 and this model you're in now has proven to provide an invaluable experience to scholars where cooperation and collaboration reign supreme and truly help prepare you for Phase 2. (edited) 
111,Harsh Hariya,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"The criteria Are 10% of the current Phase for Phase 2, So getting Really active here (Since Completing Course Is Mandatory) can be a Better choice or else what suggestion you might give",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Harsh Hariya! You can find the selection criteria for Phase 2 on our Bertelsmann Google site and every  criteria is equal in weight to progressing on!http://bit.ly/bertelsmann-tech
112,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"Brenda, How many persons work at your office?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Andrew Lawe ! I work out of our San Francisco offices (not our main headquarters in Mountain View) and the crew there is relatively small - on full days maybe 50+ people?
113,Nilay,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Hey @Brenda.Udacity I just want to thank you for providing us so much interacting community where you can learn with such great people .... Loving this,Brenda.Udacity,"Aw, thanks @Nilay! Your kind words definitely help keep us going (this is our 3rd AMA tonight!)"

115,Rao Kamran,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"@Brenda.Udacity  Does Student, leader and Tech helper have  some advantage  for selection in next phase?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Rao Kamran What counts most is genuine and meaningful participation!
116,Leah Erb,2019-11-25 0:00:00,It appears that the Study Groups Directory is now working! (edited) ,Brenda.Udacity,Hooray! Wonderful news @Leah Erb! Thanks for letting us know!

118,Adi Nugroho,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"I have requested a study group, a slack channel and itâ€™s based on a location. Letâ€™s say my request is accepted. Does the discussion in this channel counts as a contribution too, because we might discuss using our local language (non English)?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Adi Nugroho!  English is the primary language for this program but don't let that stop you from hosting your Study Group in your native language - especially if that will benefit your Study Group members!
119,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity Does gotomeeting have a whiteboard. just in case we need to have  a study jam and share live information,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Andrew Lawe! I'm afraid I'm not familiar with gotomeeting
120,Sohaib Tariq,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity why do you keep reacting to questions with the tiger emoji  ?,Brenda.Udacity,"Ah - you caught me! We use an emoji system so we don't accidentally grab a question another CM is working on  I use the Tiger because yes, as @Asjas says they are amazing (and all the men in my life are Tigers under the Chinese zodiac) "
122,Benita Ojugo Ekene-Okikere,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity can one get a compiled video for this course so as to make reference to it later.,Palak.Udacity,@Benita Ojugo Ekene-Okikere I think @Rao Kamran here just answered your question! Look for the video zip files in the resources section in the Challenge Course
123,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity please let me know when startupers and Rookies study group has launched so i can get a hold of them,Palak.Udacity,"@Andrew LaweIn about 48 hours, slack channels will be added for the study groups that have already been requested.

125,Harsh Hariya,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Do we get any goodies for the challenge completions,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Harsh Hariya - A full Scholarship to a Nanodegree program is a goodie, yes?"
126,Lesliel,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"@Brenda.Udacity if we have been accepted in phase 2, can we have the luxury to choose the course's start date?",Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Lesliel I'm afraid not  Phase 2 will open at on a specific date but if you're unable to login to your classroom until a few days later, you won't be penalized. However, you will be required to make some progress the first 1-2 weeks!"
127,Ansh,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Sorry i got late . Is ama still going on?,Jordan.Udacity,yes! feel free to drop your questions now! @Ansh
128,Krystian,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"@Brenda.Udacity Are students, in second phase are going to look more into AWS Cloud and CI/CD?",Palak.Udacity,"@Krystian Guess you have got your answer! @Lesliel As mentioned by @Aakanksha here, Phase 2 scholars will be enrolled in Cloud DevOps ND!"
129,Ansh,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"So hi. Thanks for the opportunity . Scholarship is going great. I had 2 questions.1. We all have observed there is no delete option for messages in the current workspace. Just wanted to know if there is a reason behind it , coz i am feeling this might generate more spam2. Since workspace is on a limited tier, are you guys planning to have some chat archiever service like slarck  in this workspace?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Ansh! i turned the delete option on for you all tonight I'm afraid we are unable to commit to Slarck at this time!
130,Hammad Ahmad,2019-11-25 0:00:00,"It might be a stupid question to ask, but how will you people monitor each participant's performance. I mean there are a lot of users, sending thousands of messages each day on the workplace.",Brenda.Udacity,Hii @Hammad Ahmad! I'm afraid we don't share that information and encourage you instead to focus on being a great contributor to this awesome Cloud community!
132,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-25 0:00:00,@Hammad Ahmad I see reporting analyst at my company copy and dump data in excel and run a command and it gives them a count,Palak.Udacity,@Andrew Lawe Letâ€™s keep this channel reserved for AMA session questions!
133,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-25 0:00:00,is there anyway to create a backup of all the useful weblinks that persons send in all these channels. So some of us can re-watch all their youtube videos for the persons who finish early,Palak.Udacity,"@Andrew Lawe Yes there is!In the #resources channel topic/description as you would have noticed, we have shared a airtable database where scholars from this community are gathering all useful resources for future reference and also for others to utilise them!Airtable Database of Resources: https://airtable.com/shradzeT431S2P1LCSubmit a Resource to be added to this Database:https://airtable.com/shrOrT8MZFPhWnnTt"
134,Ansh,2019-11-25 0:00:00,Also  i wish to ask would it be okay if i ask people to reply in threads ? I feel many are doing this due to lack of knowledge  and my only motive here is to keep workspace clean.,Brenda.Udacity,Here you go!

136,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-26 0:00:00,What is the limit for a study group?,Clayton.Udacity,While I don't have an exact number that I would recommend - what we would mention as a Community Team is a good number within the study group to get to know one aother on a more 1:1 basis to make the learning more accessible is best!!
137,Nilay,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Hey @Brenda.Udacity ma'am sorry due to some personal reasons i won't be able to attend this ama session sorry and please accept my apologies,Clayton.Udacity,Don't worry one bit @Nilay — Thank you for letting us know and sending a message over!
138,Marwa,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"Hi, @Brenda.Udacity �hope you’re doing great!Are we going to have a Facebook group for cloud community or the only way for community connecting will be Slack?",Grace.Udacity,Hi @Marwa! We won’t be having a Facebook group for the Bertelsmann Scholarship; Slack will be the only way to get involved with the Community!
140,Abid Malik,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"Hi @Brenda.Udacity @Clayton.Udacity  Whenever I logged in to my LMS, I see Student Sections , that's where we used to interact with our fellow students, has this been replaced with this Slack Channel now?",Brenda.Udacity,Thanks @Abid Malik! @Asjas is correct! Student Hub is the Slack like platform that Udacity created for our nanodegree students to connect with another because they do not have a Slack workspace like Scholarship students to
141,Alex,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Based on former experience what is a good group size for study groups?,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Alex! It truly depends on your goal and the preference - I've know some Study Groups that work amazing with 5 people and others that have done great with 50!  It depends on having a dedicated, passionate Study Group Organizer too!"
142,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Does Udacity have a youtube channel or plan to?,Grace.Udacity,@Andrew Lawe Check us out here! https://www.youtube.com/user/Udacity
143,Marwa,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"I remembered in the last Udacity scholarship challenge; there was #60dayswithUdactiy challenge, it was very engaging and motivating, so I wonder if we are going to have such initiative?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Marwa I'm so glad you enjoyed . the 60Days Challenge! We are considering doing it for this Scholarship too!Hi @Andrea Salcedo  60 Days of Udacity is a challenge where you take a pledge to log into your classroom and work on your material for 30 minutes for 60 consecutive days. Every day you will post a short daily update in a dedicated channel and also encourage 2 other pledges!! it's great fun!

146,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"Out of the 1,600 people graduating to phase 2. How many would you say generally get a job in their chosen track?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Andrew Lawe! While we've seen that more students find a job after they graduate from a Nanodegree program it doesn't mean that some do get one after Phase 1 too! It truly depends on your background and what skills you've acquired!�(edited)�
147,Ansh,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Hello everyone!,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Ansh!

149,Alex,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Do Bertelsmann employees get an advantage in terms of beeing selected for the next phase?,Grace.Udacity,"Hi @Alex! We’re using  the same criteria (course completion and community participation) for the Phase 2 selection process. To keep the process completely fair, there won’t be any advantages for being affiliated with Bertelsmann "
150,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"How do you recommend re-enforcing knowledge, do you think we should go outside of the references provided in course material?",Clayton.Udacity,"@Andrew Lawe I would love to hear what your community thinks about this and asking some members in a study group you may belong to —However my thoughts are that it never hurts to go over the lessons and materials more than once, physically writing your notes down as opposed to typing them and working within a group or with someone else (whether whiteboarding in person or discussing what you've learned) never hurts!"
152,Ahmed,2019-11-26 0:00:00,I am organizing a study group. So I want to know what kind of activities we can do to make the learning experience in the study group more engaging and enjoyable? @Brenda.Udacity,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Ahmed That's wonderful you're organizing a group! You''ll be a great leader! We'll be inviting all Study Group Organizers to a private channel where . we'll share a toolkit that will help you get your group underway. In the meantime, I'm all about having fun as you learn. Consider fun quizzes and games. Online meetings where you can see everyone's face are also important to help you bond as a group!"
153,Vikas,2019-11-26 0:00:00,What should I do to do keep me motivated @Brenda.Udacity. Whenever I come to ask doubt on slack I am afraid to see people have already finished those chapter and are very ahead on me.,Clayton.Udacity,"@Vikas You may have heard of the phrase ""The grass is always greener on the other side."" I preefer and I use this phrase a lot, ""The grass is greenest where you water it."" That means to focus and go at your own pace and you will see so much growth!Don't worry about where others are at in Phase 1 of this course. What matters is that you go at your own pace and that you retain the material that you've learned! Remember that this is about learning for yourself to become an improved Cloud DevOps professional.Keep it up @Vikas!�(edited)�"
154,Andrew Lawe,2019-11-26 0:00:00,is there a link in the course material along the way which provides access to active open-source project groups,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Andrew Lawe I don't believe there is but this community is a wonderful opportunity to start such a   project!
155,Harsh Hariya,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"Since there are many Study groups, is it important that only study topics shud be the main concern",Clayton.Udacity,"@Harsh Hariya What is most important is that you find the study groups where you believe will help you the most, and also where you believe you can make an impact and provide value!If none immediately pop out at you, have you thought about making a study group of your own?"
157,Oskar Linder,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"i only see about 8 study groups when i check the channels i can join, are those all that have been created so far?",Clayton.Udacity,"@Oskar Linder That's correct! More will be live shortly. We ask that you allow ~48 business hours for the study groups to go live, and keep an eye on the directory as others will be added as well!"
159,Alex,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Will there be AMAs on a regular basis throughout the entire course duration or just for the first couple of weeks?,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Alex! We'll be reducing the schedule to 1x week but we will continue them until this Scholarship ends on March 5th as @Anshsaid. So you're stuck with us for awhile!
160,Rao Kamran,2019-11-26 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity  What happen is someone get ill  and how he is contributing in ama session? is there any chance for carry on  for participation point of view,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Rao Kamran! Hopefully no one will too ill to continue but please know that AMAs are just one of many many ways to contribute to this community!
161,Talha Ahmed,2019-11-26 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity �joined todays ama from office with a cup of tea of course  But the question I have today seems to be a bit odd what is a nano degree anyway I have heard this term for the first time. Can you share some light on this topic,Grace.Udacity,Hi @Talha Ahmed! A Nanodegree is basically what you receive from completing a Nanodegree course! It will give you hands on knowledge on all the principles used in Cloud roles today. It’s prepping you for skills to use in a job instead of getting a degree in a traditional setting where you would spend 4 years learning theory along with application
162,Rao Kamran,2019-11-26 0:00:00,@Brenda.Udacity can we share our udacity  login with our colleagues for knowledge purpose??�(edited)�,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Rao Kamran We ask that you please do not. That would be a violation of your Terms of Use.�(edited)�
163,Vikas,2019-11-26 0:00:00,Is it necessary to join study groups?,Clayton.Udacity,"@Vikas While it is not required, it certainly is recommended! Study Groups will help you find a smaller, core group of other challengers where you can learn about them, ask questions, work on possible future personal projects, or anything!The possibilities are endless so I would recommend finding one that interests you.�(edited)�"
165,Joann,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"I logged in to the classroom with the email I used to sign up for the Phase 1 application. It is my old id, which I no longer use. And I accidentally used my new id to log in to slack. Is that going to be a problem? I've been getting mails to my old id asking me to join slack. What should I do about it? Should I change my email id in the classroom or should I login to slack using my new one?",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Joann Thank you for asking! The answer is it is very important that the email you use to log into your classroom matches the email that you login to Slack . which should also match the email on your application! I would do what makes sense so that you meet the above!
166,Joann,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"I logged in to the classroom with the email I used to sign up for the Phase 1 application. It is my old id, which I no longer use.

186,Ahmed,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"What is the duration for phase 2? I have heard somewhere it is 6 months. It seems odd for a nanodegree, doesn't it? @Brenda.Udacity",Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Ahmed That's correct! Phase 2 will be 6 months - There will be numerous technical projects you'll need to complete and pass. We want to ensure everyone has time to graduate!�(edited)�

188,Enas,2019-11-26 0:00:00,What is the criteria of selecting student leaders?,Brenda.Udacity,"Hi @Enas! We'll be looking for a variety of things - background, location, strong desire to help others! We want to have a nice mix as well as good channel coverage as this truly is a global community!"
191,Harsh Hariya,2019-11-26 0:00:00,So how much time it will do to see all the study groups ?,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Harsh Hariya! Right now on our Study Groups page we have quite a few Study Groups already in our Directory! We'll keep the registration form up until the end of this program so new Study can always be added. https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/bertelsmann-challenge/cloud-track/cloud-study-groups
192,Ahmed,2019-11-26 0:00:00,"Talking about time, what would be a great advice  you give/receive regarding time management?",Grace.Udacity,"Hi @Ahmed, I usually either write down or use Notion (https://www.notion.so/) to make a list of things I need to do on a certain day and do them from highest priority to least! It’s pretty simple, but it’s a tried and true method "
194,Nilay,2019-11-26 0:00:00,hey @Brenda.Udacity as I am making a transcript for yesterday's ama session so I will make the transcript for this one also and my question is should i make it combined if both the sessions or different one??,Brenda.Udacity,Hi @Nilay!  Thank you! I believe @Ahmed is working on one too. May I ask that you both sync up? I Would hate you to do double work!
196,Rodrick B.,2019-11-26 0:00:00,What kind of Slack app integration will be available?,Brenda.Udacity,"I do love me some Trello @Rodrick B.. Traditionally we've not added anything other then the basics (e.g. Polly, Giphy) but let me see if there's any privacy reasons that would prevent us from adding more."
197,Alex,2019-11-26 0:00:00,If I remember correctly (I think it was a letter from the Bertelsmann CEO regarding these Udacity courses) about 60% of Nanodegree students actually finished their degrees last year. Is there a chance that students initially rejected can be accepted later on if many people quit early?,Clayton.Udacity,"@Alex Thanks for asking this Alex. While acceptance has been closed for this scholarship, please keep an eye out for future Udacity scholarships as more will certainly be available in 2020. There will always be more opportunity!"
